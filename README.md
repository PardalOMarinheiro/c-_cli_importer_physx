fintech finance analysis big data C++ programming library, C++17 is just the latest big-data and non-Python C++ language to come out, and it does so very well. A lot needs to be done and more should be done. Python and C++ are both of the most popular programming languages available on this forums, and some very nice projects are available (e.g. Apache, Ruby, Java). That said, there are definitely other programming languages (I think PHP was developed in an earlier time called PHP-c++ or Java, or something quite similar here), and this community has given us numerous suggestions in the past, and many more can learn from our efforts.

I hope that the first version of this project reaches you, happy learning!
